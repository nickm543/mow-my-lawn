# mow-my-lawn
A game about lawn mowing written for my x86 Assembly final project.

The idea of the game is that you try to mow as much grass as possible before running out of gas. Also, don't run over the flowers or Mom will get mad. Oh, and don't hit rocks. Mower blades are expensive.

Note: This project uses a helper file called 'asm_io' that I couldn't include in the repository, so for now, you won't be able to compile it sadly.
